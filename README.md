# [Hayley's Event Listener's HW](https://github.com/hhmcdonald/hw_listeners_mcdonald_hayley)

## Resources

* [HTML5 Forms Reference](https://www.sitepoint.com/html5-forms-markup/) I used this source as a reference for my form HTML5 elements. It had been a few months since I had written a form from scratch, so this was a great refresher.
* [Git Branching](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging) I used this source to make sure I was creating and checking out branches correctly as I moved through the assignment. I didn't have to use this much, but I used it to check myself.

## Comments

* This was a challenging assignment, but it taught me a lot about the possibilities of Event Listening. I can really see the benefit of knowing these skills for front-end and back-end benefits. I had a difficult time with the form submission. It seems to be logging correctly now, but I had a hard time getting it to list out each submission in the console. I enjoyed having some freedom in the last branch to come up with some events on our own. This forced me to think outside the box a bit and experiment with some events I may want to use on pages in the future. Overall, this was a very applicable and enjoyable assignment to learn from!
